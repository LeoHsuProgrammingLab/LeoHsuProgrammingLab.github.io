I am a graduate research assistant in the Communications and Multimedia Lab at National Taiwan University (NTU). In my research, I use computer vision techniques and object detection to improve the healthcare monitoring system.

At the same time, I am a master's student in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources Conservation at NTU. I work on efficient Android mobile application development of forest survey and forest mensuration. My aspiration is to apply AI and software to different domains such as forestry and healthcare. Although I am a forestry major student, I am absorbed in computer science with 45 course credits and the above projects. Currently, I am applying for a master's degree in computer science and computer engineering.

I was a student-athlete when I studied in bachelor's degree at NTU. I had been the captain of [NTU Owls](https://www.facebook.com/ntubasketballteam/) from 2019 to 2021. I led the team to be the only team without any basketball-specialized students in Division 1 in Taiwan.
I have been a super Lakers fan since the 2007-08 season. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant. After he retired, I enjoyed Rajon Rondo's game, and I tried hard to imitate both of them in my games. Besides, I love tactics design, especially for zone defense, full court press, and 5-out motion offense.
