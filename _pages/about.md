I am a graduate research assistant in the Communications and Multimedia Lab at National Taiwan University (NTU). In my research, I use computer vision techniques and object detection to improve the healthcare monitoring system.

At the same time, I am a master's student in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources Conservation at NTU. I work on efficient Android mobile application development of forest survey and forest mensuration. My aspiration is to apply AI and software to different domains such as forestry and healthcare. Although I am a forestry major student, I am absorbed in computer science with 45 course credits and the above projects. Currently, I am applying for a master's degree in computer science and computer engineering.

I was a student-athlete when I studied in bachelor's degree at NTU. I had been the captain of [NTU Owls](https://www.facebook.com/ntubasketballteam/) from 2019 to 2021. I led the team to be the [only team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFGGtNWDhlA&list=PLUfT0s3t7xLRbK0RMdu0fdyOxNEkWIQGM&index=1) without any basketball-specialized students in Division 1 in Taiwan ([more](https://medium.com/@hooptaiwan/hbl%E7%94%B2%E7%B5%84%E5%85%89%E7%92%B0%E5%8F%8D%E6%80%9D-%E5%BD%B0%E5%8C%96%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%B4%A0%E4%BA%BA%E7%B1%83%E7%90%83%E5%A4%A2-ae4d086c9f85)).
I have been a super Lakers fan since the 2007-08 season. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant. After he retired, I enjoyed Rajon Rondo's game. Besides, I love tactics design, especially for zone defense, full court press, and 5-out motion offense.
