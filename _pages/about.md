I am a graduate research assistant in the Communications and Multimedia Lab at National Taiwan University (NTU). In my research, I use computer vision techniques and object detection to improve the healthcare monitoring system.

At the same time, I am a master's student in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources Conservation at NTU. I work on efficient Android mobile application development of forest survey and forest mensuration. My aspiration is to apply AI and software to different domains such as forestry and healthcare.

I was a student athlete when I studied in bachelor's degree at NTU. I had been the captain of [NTU Owls](https://www.facebook.com/ntubasketballteam/) from 2019 to 2021.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
